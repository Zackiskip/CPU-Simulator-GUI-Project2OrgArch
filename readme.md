## CPU-Simulator GUI
A grahical user interface application with these components: CPU Simulator, QR code and Barcode Generator.


## Running the Application
download contents of the repoistory and to launc hit you will need visual studio to open the solution file to run it.
once install you can run the application through form 1 startup file.

now that the application is running you can use the CPU simulator to simulate a CPU's scheduling algorithms. 

If you go to the tab or page through the bar on the left or the tabs on top you can pick one the 2nd option in each to move to the different algorithms.

You should type into the process bar at the top the amount of processes you want to simulate then select the algorithm you will want to test with the amount of processes.

Having a data set on hand that is recorded for different values is recommended but not required you can just put in random data amounts instead of having a set amount but having a set data for implementation is recommended for comparing the different algorithms

Every algorithm will prompt you for the burst time, some processes such as round robin will ask for the arrival time, others like priority need the priority for each piece of burst time, and round robin will also need the time quantum for the algorithm to run.

once you run the algorithm is will display information pertaining to each individual process and then give you an average for the wait times and the turn around times for the overall algorithm, it will also display the total time it spent running.

You can also use the qrcode generator to create a qrcode related to information that you want, this will also give you a text generator which don't seem to be related to the cpu simulator.
